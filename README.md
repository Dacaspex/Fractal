# Fractal
### description
This program can draw and render fractals to images and videos. The user can choose between a variety of fractals and color schemes. Everything packed in a neat GUI and programmer API. The program also provides an option to discover fractals and zoom in very far. Create simple animations or complex ones with the animator options.

### About the project
This project is mainly for fun. I am not planning on making this for commercial use. I enjoy to solve the challenges that come up with such a project. Drawing fractals can be really interesting, but making beautiful color schemes/images/animations can be very tricky. I try to provide a solution for this problem by creating a nice user interface and also a programmer API.
